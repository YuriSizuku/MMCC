A mini make c compiler including

* preprocessing
* scanning (lexical analysis)
* parsing (syntax analysis)
* symantic analysis & icgen (intermediate code generation)

to compile a programe wrote by a subset of c language

* The compiler's architecture detailed methods are in 
[mmcc_design](https://github.com/YuriSizuku/MMCC/blob/master/doc/mmcc_design.txt "mmcc_design")
* The intermediate results for debug are in 
[debug_view](https://github.com/YuriSizuku/MMCC/blob/master/samples/debugview_v0.2.9.txt "debug_view")
